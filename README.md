# Ft_irc
This server IRC made in c++ was a project from school 42.


Usage : You should type "make" so everything will compile creating the executable ./ircserv

then you could run the server with "./ircserv #port# #password#"

You can now connect with a irc client like irssi.
Irssi was the client we mostly used for testing our server.

this project was made in collaboration with Toueis.
